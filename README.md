This script takes a CSV output from [Fidelity Investments] (https://fidelity.com) and converts it to the format required to import trades into [Tradezella] (https://tradezella.com).  
At the time of creating the script, Tradezella did not have a native way to import Fidelity orders.  That may have changed by now...

Tradezella is a great trade journaling tool, but didn't work well with my style of trading.  As for Fidelity - It's absolute garbage of a broker.  If you're serious about doing any sort of active trading, I suggest you look at other active trader friendly brokers that have updated to business in the 21st century.
